# MiniMIPS
An implementation of a MIPS processor using logisim. At the moment, it does not support memory instrucrtions. These will be implemented later. Logisim can be downloaded here https://sourceforge.net/projects/logisimevolution/. I have also included the download file for the OSX wrapper and the jar in my ALU repository
